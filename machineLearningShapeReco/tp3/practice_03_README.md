## Getting started
This session uses the following Jupyter notebooks:
- `practice_03-00_intro.ipynb`
- `practice_03-01_ORB_AR.ipynb`

To start working, launch a terminal and navigate to the content of this archive.
Then, run [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/):
```shell
jupyter notebook
```

Of course, you need to make sure all the required modules are installed.
You can install then all, **for your current user only,** using the following command:
```shell
pip install --user -r practice_03_requirements.txt
```

Then, open the first notebook: `practice_03-00_intro.ipynb`.
