## Getting started
This session uses the following Jupyter notebooks:
- `practice_02-00_intro.ipynb`
- `practice_02-01_detection-description.ipynb`
- `practice_02-02_twinit-part2-matching.ipynb`

To start working, launch a terminal and navigate to the content of this archive.
Then, run [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/):
```shell
jupyter notebook
```

Of course, you need to make sure all the required modules are installed.
You can install then all, **for your current user only,** using the following command:
```shell
pip install --user -r practice_02_requirements.txt
```

**Please note that we now require `scikit-learn` which was not necessary for the first session.**

Then, open the first notebook: `practice_02-00_intro.ipynb`.
